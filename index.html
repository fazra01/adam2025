      <p>Adam wakes to a face without eyes and a self he no longer recognizes.

      <p>
        Fadi Azra, born and raised in Syria, is a 21-year-old artist and third-year student at 
        Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts. He is from Al-Bayadiyah and attended Amir 
        Ibrahim High School in Hama before moving to the United States in 2023. He began his 
        college career at the Tufts School of the Museum of Fine Arts and later transferred 
        to Tufts’ Combined Degree Program, where he is pursuing a Bachelor of Fine Arts and 
        a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Psychology (Human Factors Engineering).
      </p>
      <p>
        Fadi’s artistic practice centres on storytelling through stop-motion animation, painting, 
        and drawing. A lifelong artist, Fadi began making puppets and painting at the age of six 
        and continues to explore creative approaches to expression that bridge his fine arts 
        background with psychological inquiry.

        <summary><strong>Haunted in limbo between remembering and forgetting</strong></summary>
    <p>
    When memory fades and no longer shields us from the terrifying uncertainty of 
    losing who we are, where we came from, and what we’ve endured, physical surroundings 
    often become the last anchors to our past identity. A familiar scent, a family photo, 
    or an old passport becomes a silent witness to who we once were. But what happens 
    when even those tangible remnants begin to fade, feel foreign, and conflict with 
    the truth we carry deep inside? When the physical starts to betray us, we’re left 
    disoriented and haunted by being in limbo between remembering and forgetting.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Adam</em> is my depiction of that fear — the fear of forgetting where I came from. 
    It is my way of processing the ache of distance, the fragility of memory, and the 
    erosion of identity that time brings. I’ve been away from Syria, my home, for two years now. 
    I know I’ll continue living in the United States while pursuing my education for at least 
    the next three years. And with each passing day, I wrestle with a growing fear: 
    what if I forget what it means to be Syrian? What if I wake up one day and no longer 
    recognize the feelings, smells, and stories that once shaped me? To hold on to my origins 
    and identity, I surround myself with objects that remind me of home. But these fragments, 
    though meaningful, often feel small and powerless in the larger spaces I now occupy. 
    They aren’t enough to fully preserve who I was, and I worry that even they are beginning 
    to lose their connection to the world they came from.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Adam</em> is not just a character; he is me, and he is anyone who has ever feared losing 
    their connection to their homeland. This story is both deeply personal and universally 
    resonant, asking the question: what defines us when everything familiar begins to slip away?

      <h2>The Making of <em>Adam</em></h2>
  
  <details id="puppet">
  <summary><strong>Puppet</strong></summary>

  <p>
    I’ve been making dolls since I was six years old. In my first attempts, I melted plastic 
    hangers to form joints, used eggshells for heads, and wrapped yarn around wire to create 
    bodies. Later came my DIY fairy dolls that were crafted with wires, fake flowers, and 
    scraps of fabric. So, when it came time to make <em>Adam</em>, it felt as if I had come 
    full circle. Building him was one of my favorite parts of the entire filmmaking process.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first sketch of Adam appeared one night during my first year of college. I had been 
    thinking about what it meant to leave home — and the fear that, with time, I might begin 
    to lose my memory of home. From that thought, and from the tears that followed, Adam was born.
  </p>

  <div style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:repeat(auto-fit,minmax(250px,1fr));gap:1rem;margin:1rem 0;">

  <p>
    The prototype version of Adam became my first real experiment in stop-motion puppet building. 
    As a college student with limited resources, I couldn’t afford a professional ball-and-socket 
    skeleton, so I built his frame out of wire. After animating with him for a semester, I quickly 
    learned the downsides — wires break easily and can’t hold consistent poses.
  </p>

  <figure style="margin:0;">
  <div style="position:relative;width:100%;max-width:860px;aspect-ratio:16/9;border-radius:12px;border:1px solid var(--border);overflow:hidden;">

  <figcaption class="sub" style="font-size:.85rem;margin-top:.35rem;">
    first stop-motion animation test with Adam
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p style="margin-top:1rem;">
    A year later, I received a small grant from my university — around $200 — which I used to 
    invest in a proper ball-and-socket armature and hands. That upgrade transformed the puppet’s 
    movement and durability, and from there, the final version of Adam came to life.
  </p>
  <p>
    To bring Adam’s body to completion, I sculpted epoxy clay carefully around the skeleton, 
    then wrapped it with a thin layer of fiber filling before dressing him. This layering gave 
    him smooth, natural bends at the joints. His head was also made from epoxy sculpt, and I 
    hand-painted the face with acrylics. I hand-sewed all of Adam’s clothes from scrap fabrics — 
    his shirt, in fact, was made from one of my own striped shirts. That small detail mattered 
    to me; I saw Adam as an extension of myself, and incorporating something of my own felt 
    like giving him a part of my story.
  </p>
	
</details>
	<details id="set">
    <summary><strong>Set</strong></summary>
    <p>
      The elements of Adam’s world were handmade. The set’s furniture — the desk, bed, side table, closet, and walls — was built entirely from wood. I attached a metal sheet beneath the floor of the set, covered it with a thin layer of dark blue fabric, and placed small magnets inside Adam’s shoes to help control his steps during animation.
    </p>

	<p>
	One of the most time-consuming props was the stack of tiny passports that appears in the film. I gathered stock images of passports from countries all over the world, printed them on cardstock, and hand-cut and folded each one. In total, I made about 500 miniature passports — a process that took nearly three weeks to complete.
	</p>
	<img src="Images/set4.jpeg" alt="Adam film set 4" 
       style="width:100%;max-width:860px;height:auto;border-radius:12px;border:1px solid var(--border);margin:1rem 0;">
	<p>
	The repetition and slowness of making those passports became an essential part of the process. When I thought about what forms someone’s identity, I realized how overwhelming it is — the countless elements that 	shape who we are. Each passport felt like a small fragment of that identity: what it could mean, what it could’ve meant, or what it might still mean in the future. That sense of fracture, confusion, and the 		constant re-evaluation of identity found its way into the rhythm of my hands — sitting at a table, cutting these tiny, colorful papers that carried so much symbolic weight.
